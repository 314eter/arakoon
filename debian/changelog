arakoon (0.8.2-1) unstable; urgency=low
  This cycle the focus was on bugfixing.
  Full details are in the Arakoon Jira. Here's the quick list
  * [ARAKOON-133] Arakoon daemon takes GBytes of memory when doing large catchup in combination with debug logging enabled
  * [ARAKOON-132] Arakoon server crashed as a result of 'invalid store update request'
  * [ARAKOON-131] Catchup fails if it starts from a multiple of the number of tlog entries per tlog file
  * [ARAKOON-130] Slave cannot promise on same n more than once
  * [ARAKOON-129] Arakoon node runs out of file descriptors when compressing tlog
  * [ARAKOON-128] Slave considers master lease expired when it's not
  * [ARAKOON-127] Log last n debug log messages when the state machine crashes
  * [ARAKOON-126] There are still some corner cases where we probably don't do the right thing
  * [ARAKOON-125] In case of master reelection or catchup slaves do not always push previous uncommited updates in the store
  * [ARAKOON-124] Masterlease uses absolute timestamps as part of the update value
  * [ARAKOON-123] Log rotation should reload log configuration
  * [ARAKOON-122] expectprogress returns incorrect or no value in forced master setup when slave is not running
  * [ARAKOON-121] Slave dies when receiving promis which n is higher than expected
  * [ARAKOON-120] Restarting a forced master at the wrong time can lead to cluster without progress
  * [ARAKOON-119] Node should die when a corrupt tc is encountered at runtime
  * [ARAKOON-118] tlog iteration starting from the wrong value starts in the wrong tlog file
  * [ARAKOON-117] When a slave goes to election mode, the previous update is not always pushed to the store
  * [ARAKOON-115] Updates can be pushed into the store twice which under certain conditions can lead to data loss
  * [ARAKOON-114] Interuption of tlog compression results in half compressed tlogs which are treated as a normal tlog
  * [ARAKOON-112] when arakoon node is down, but machine is up, connecting nodes hammer
  * [ARAKOON-111] Monkey dies with "Lwt.wakeup invalid argument"
  * [ARAKOON-110] State machine fails when running as master, it receives a message from newly elected master
  * [ARAKOON-109] Election timeout is not always fired with can lead to master-less cluster
  * [ARAKOON-107] Specifying tlog directory with Pylabs Arakoon extension results in error
  * [ARAKOON-106] Master election can get in a loop
  * [ARAKOON-105] If system clock is changed lease is not invalidated
  * [ARAKOON-103] Number of tlogs is limited to 1000
  * [ARAKOON-102] Provide clone functionality
  * [ARAKOON-101] Improve catchup speed
  * [ARAKOON-100] Provide basic load statistics
  * [ARAKOON-99] Store can get ahead of tlogs
  * [ARAKOON-98] Empty node can become master
  * [ARAKOON-97] Automatically truncate tlogs if they are corrupt
  * [ARAKOON-95] Add repair option that can be used in case of tlog corruption
  * [ARAKOON-94] having a machine that is not live in an arakoon config makes the cluster slow
  * [ARAKOON-93] Master restart can lead to a missed update in the slave store
  * [ARAKOON-92] Retry during master election does not always retry correctly
  * [ARAKOON-91] Arakoon getStatus() and getStatusOne returns unwanted PID information
  * [ARAKOON-90] node dies if too many clients connect
  * [ARAKOON-85] Failing system test: Disk full on slave
  * [ARAKOON-83] Add possibility to define clusterid for a certain set of Arakoon nodes
  * [ARAKOON-82] Add protocol version check
  * [ARAKOON-81] With forced master, the master's store counter can get ahead of the tlogs
  * [ARAKOON-79] Tlog rollover can make catchup fail
  * [ARAKOON-78] expect_progress_possible returns true in scenarios where a slave is in catchup
  * [ARAKOON-77] Lease can expire without being stored
  * [ARAKOON-76] multicast of messages is serial, which sometimes gives bad performance
  * [ARAKOON-71] Run Arakoon as a different user

  * [ARAKOON-75] Master Election issue in degraded state after restarting remaining
  * [ARAKOON-61] Frequently restarting the master node in a cluster node under load scenario might lead
                 to cluster unavailability
  * [ARAKOON-64] multi-get support
  * [ARAKOON-48] Request the state of a server node
  * [ARAKOON-66] Delete of non-existing key messes up tlog and store counters
  * [ARAKOON-63] Transactions lead to non-transactional behaviour
