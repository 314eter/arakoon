\section{Restart and Failure Scenarios}
Comprehension greatly benefits from writing out explicitly what should happen after a failure\footnote{Something we learned the hard way}.

\subsection{General power failure, after which the master is dead meat}
\tablehead{
  \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{A}& 
  \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{B}&
  \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{C}
  \\\hline}
\begin{supertabular}{|cl|cl|cl|}
  000 & $^s$MasterSet('C',\ldots) & 000 & $^s$ MasterSet('C',\ldots) & 000 & MasterSet('C',\ldots) \\
  001 & $^t$Set('x','X')          & 001 & $^t$ Set('x','X')          & 001 & $^{s,t}$Set('x','X')   \\
\hline
\end{supertabular}
\paragraph{}
The table shows the situation when the power goes off. 
Node C became master and dictated 1 update (\emph{Set('x','X')}), received \emph{Accepted} messages from all slaves,
after which it pushed that update to its store. 
The question is, what happens when node C is lost and A and B are started again.

\paragraph{}
It's obvious that globally, there should be consensus on the \emph{Set} update, but since there was no follow up, 
both nodes don't realise this yet, and are trying to find out what should happen.
A sends out a \emph{Prepare(n,i=1)} to which B answers with a \emph{Promise(n,i=1,Set('x','X'))}.
All goes well, and A receives the promise, and thus decides that this is indeed the value for \emph{i=1}.
It pushes the value, to the store. Node A goest into a state identical to C, before it became defunct.
\paragraph{}
If node A gets this far, it's a de-facto leader, and can start acting like it. 
The next thing A does is broadcast \emph{Accept(n,2,MasterSet('A',\ldots)} and things will soon be normal again.
