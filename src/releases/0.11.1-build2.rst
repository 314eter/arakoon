Remarks
=======
Upgrading from Arakoon versions older than 0.10.0 requires the following steps:

- Stop all nodes of your Arakoon cluster
- Update the binaries / QPackages depending on your installation setup
- Execute the ``q.manage.arakoon.upgrade()`` method on every node of your Arakoon cluster
- Start all nodes of your Arakoon cluster
- **Make sure you RESTART the q-shell AFTER executing the upgrade method in order the unload the old command tools extensions from the q-shell!**

Upgrading from Arakoon version 0.10.0 and above supports rolling upgrades:

- Stop one node of your Arakoon cluster
- Update the binaries / QPackages depending on your installation setup
- Execute the q.manage.arakoon.upgrade() method on every node of your Arakoon cluster
- Start the node again
- Perform the steps above on every node of your Arakoon cluster
